WEEK1

For this week I did mainly research on a couple of games to
come up with ideas for the game proposal this week. I picked 3 tile based games
which I thought had interesting mechanics and would be simple to implement or
add a twist to. These three games were: Crypt of the Necrodancer, Helltaker, and Hoplite.
Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm based dungeon crawler with some roguelike aspects. Helltaker is a
limited turn tile based puzzle game. And Hoplite is a turn based roguelike for mobile.

I first thought we could take one of the games and put a spin on it, however, I felt like possibly
a combination of the games would create for interesting mechanics. Something along
the lines of a limited turn based puzzle top down dungeon crawler. In the end with some of my inital ideas, 
I helped our team came up with the concept of a top down limited movement dungeon crawler with ocassional puzzle aspects.
I also ended up creating a possible brain visual for our game. I also helped out with the creation of the game design document and
aided in the recognition of some possible design flaws and how we could solve it otherwise.

I also downloaded the Unity game engine this week in combination with visual studio for coding C#
for the Unity game engine. I had spent some time trying to get familiar with the interface and explored 
some online tutorials, espeically those of Brackeys from youtube. I ended up creating a mini 3D sliding game 
prototype using one of his video tutorials. I believe this will be very helpful with starting me off on
my journey to learn this game engine.
