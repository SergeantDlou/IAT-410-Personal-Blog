WEEK1

For this week I did mainly research on a couple of games to
come up with ideas for the game proposal this week. I picked 3 tile based games
which I thought had interesting mechanics and would be simple to implement or
add a twist to. These three games were: Crypt of the Necrodancer, Helltaker, and Hoplite.

I first thought we could take one of the games and put a spin on it, however, I felt like possibly
a combination of the games would create for interesting mechanics. Something along
the lines of a limited turn based puzzle top down dungeon crawler. In the end our team came up with
a top down limited movement dungeon crawler with ocassional puzzle aspects.
